// Command access-connector-worker runs the queue handlers that exercise the
// access connector framework (sync_identities, provision_access, ...) plus
// the periodic crons that drive the access platform: anomaly detection,
// credential expiry checks, and (Phase 5) campaign scheduling.
//
// The Phase 0 scaffold logs startup and the registered providers so the
// binary builds and serves as the blank-import host for connector init()
// side-effects. Phase 6 wiring exposes WireCronJobs as a pure function so
// the cron set is unit-testable without actually starting goroutines.
